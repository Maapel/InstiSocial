# InstiSocial : Navigate & Explore Events Like Never Before! 

## Overview 
In the vibrant tapestry of college fests and meets, navigating through numerous events often feels like exploring a maze without a map. I encountered that I myself ,in my college's Tech Fest wasn't able to attend few events which I would love to , because I was unaware of those , as plenty of events were happening at the same time. To tackle this challenge and infuse excitement into the process, we birthed InstiSocial.

## Usage

1] Download the InstiSocial.apk from repository \
2] Add events in the webapp: https://maadhav17.pythonanywhere.com/add_event \
3] Try out the app , go to the location of the event and you should be able to see the event schedule , and interact with it.
